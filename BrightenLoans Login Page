Payday loans charge borrowers high levels of interest and do not require any collateral, making them a type of unsecured personal loan. These loans may be considered predatory lending, as they have extremely high interest, don’t consider a borrower’s ability to repay, and have hidden provisions that charge borrowers added fees.
As a result, they can create a debt trap for consumers. If you’re considering a payday loan, then you may want to look first at safer personal loan alternatives.
